# Python Callable Instances

### The Pythonic Way To Create A Simple And Yet Efficient Cache.

A simples but efficient way to implement a caching police to improve peformace. And in the process we are going to lern the how to use the build in `__call__`, which allows instaces of classes to be callable objects.

### Setup

1. Assuming you have Python setup, run the following commands (if you're on Windows you may use `py` or `py -3` instead of `python` to start Python):

   ```
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

   ```

### Test

1. To run Pytest suite do as follows.

   ```
